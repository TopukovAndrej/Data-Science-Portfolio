# Data Science Portfolio
This repository contains all of my data science projects that I have created in my free time for self learning purposes. Other projects may be added as well.

*NOTE: All datasets located in the data folder are for demonstration purposes only.

- [SMS Ham/Spam Classification](.ipynb Notebooks/SMS Classification.ipynb)

The goal of this project was to classify SMS messages as ham or spam. I have used several techniques to preprocess the messages and used several techniques to obtain feature vectors (Bag of Words, TF-IDF vectors and Keras Tokenizer). To classify the messages, I used several ML models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest classifier and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Also, I created a Deep Learning model - RNN, that gave the best results (as expected). The ML models gave better results with the TF-IDF vectors, than with the Bag of Words vectors.
